# Robocord
Robocord is a bot created for the community of the Pycord Server.
Just a bot created for <a href=https://discord.gg/pycord>Pycord Server</a>. You can start pull requests, I will check it and if its good I will add it to the bot. üëç

I recommend you do not try to install the whole code and copy it, since certain things here and there are not really defined, for example, token. Some variables are stored in env files, so you might get a lot of undefined errors. You can copy the code of specific sections you want, but copying, say, the error handler will probably give you a lot of errors and not help you learn anything.
