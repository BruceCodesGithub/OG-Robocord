Robocord has been moved and this repo is no longer supporting contributions. Please Open Pull Requests in [the new repo](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/Robocord) instead.

The reason Robocord was moved is because the Pycord Server Owner wanted to become its owner. The new Robocord is now a public bot and the contributers to this repo no longer manage it.

## Self Hosting

I recommend you do not try to install the whole code and copy it, since certain things here and there
are not really defined, for example, token. Some variables are stored in env files, so you might get a lot of
undefined errors. You can copy the code of specific sections you want, but copying, say, the error handler will
probably give you a lot of errors and not help you learn anything.
<!-- might wanna change in the future idk -->
